# hit-the-sound-running

This is our submission to the mercedes benz case for starthack 2021. 
Our prototype can identify positive and negative emotions and changes the music based on these emotions. 
For a more detailed description check out our draft.pdf


To run the code follow these steps:

* Make sure you have all the required libraries installed: opencv, keras, tensorflow, numpy and playsound

* Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone github.com/aaron-visschedijk/hit-the-sound-running`

* Move to the `/src` directory and run `python main.py`


The provided model was trained using the [fer2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data).
Furthermore, our neural network code is partly inspired by https://github.com/neha01/Realtime-Emotion-Detection.
